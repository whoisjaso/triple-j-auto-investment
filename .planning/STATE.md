## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v2.0 starts at Phase 9 (continuous numbering from v1)
- Staying on Supabase Free plan for now (dev/testing) -- Pro upgrade deferred
- Existing Supabase project (scgmpliwlfabnpygvbsy) used for development, not fresh project
- Migrations 04-08 applied via Supabase MCP (tracked in supabase_migrations table)
- pg_cron/pg_net sections skipped in migrations (requires Pro plan)
- 11 phases derived from psychological funnel stages + infrastructure/polish
- Phases 10-12 can partially overlap after Phase 9
- Phase 16 (Intelligence) can start independently after Phase 9
- Edge Functions deployed to existing dev project (not fresh production)
- **[10-01]** Internal JS key names (arsenal, vault, psych) kept unchanged; only customer-visible values rewritten to avoid breaking cross-file references
- **[10-01]** Fake Live Signals replaced with honest dealership info ticker (Option A from plan) rather than removed
- **[10-01]** FAQ Q&A and service descriptions embedded directly in translations.ts as arrays of objects
- **[10-01]** Phone number standardized to (832) 400-9760 across all translation keys

- **[10-02]** "Logistics Coordination" (out-of-state shipping) removed as unverified service
- **[10-02]** FAQ switched from 5 English-only categories to flat bilingual list from t.faq.questions[]
- **[10-02]** "What We Don't Do" section added to translations as t.services.dontDo for proper bilingual support
- **[10-03]** Footer expanded from 3-column to 4-column layout to add phone, hours, and social links
- **[10-03]** Wire transfer payment option replaced with debit card in PaymentOptions.tsx to match translations and $3K-$8K price range
- **[10-03]** Mobile menu jargon subtitles (ORIGIN POINT, ACQUIRE ASSETS, etc.) removed rather than replaced
- **[10-03]** Desktop/mobile "INTEL" nav label replaced with t.vinLookup.badge for bilingual support
- **[10-04]** Admin-only "Sovereign CFO" prompt in geminiService.ts kept unchanged (not customer-facing)
- **[10-04]** Phone numbers standardized to (832) 400-9760 across entire codebase including emailService.ts and pdfService.ts
- **[10-04]** Codebase-wide jargon sweep confirms zero SOVEREIGN framework terminology in customer-facing content
- **[10-05]** index.html title, meta description, keywords, OG tags, and schema.org all rewritten for honest pre-owned dealer positioning
- **[10-05]** Schema.org priceRange corrected to $3000-$8000 (was $5000-$50000)
- **[10-05]** Schema.org paymentAccepted updated: Wire Transfer replaced with Debit Card (consistent with 10-03)
- **[10-06]** VIN validation error codes kept as technical strings (not translated) -- universal technical codes
- **[10-06]** Bold text in translated paragraphs uses split-string pattern (introBefore/introHighlight/introAfter)
- **[10-06]** Payment methods in policies stored as {method, detail} object arrays matching services.list pattern

### Completed Work (Phase 9)

- **09-03 (partial):** 3 Edge Functions deployed via MCP (process-notification-queue, unsubscribe, check-plate-alerts). 4 storage buckets created (rental-agreements private, 3 public). 5 storage RLS policies. Security fixes: vehicles_backup RLS + registration_notifications policies. Missing: Edge Function secrets (manual), pg_cron/pg_net (Pro plan), app.settings (Pro plan).
- **09-04 (complete):** 22 deprecated files deleted (Docker, Dokploy, dev scripts, outdated docs). .env.production replaced with empty template. .gitignore updated. 5 credential pattern scans return zero matches.

### Completed Work (Phase 10) -- ALL COMPLETE

- **10-01 (complete):** Rewrote translations.ts (376 to 808 lines) with honest bilingual content. All SOVEREIGN jargon replaced. 9 new sections added (about, finance, policies, legal, notFound, vinLookup, paymentOptions, expanded faq+services). Rewrote Home.tsx: removed SubliminalPrime component, removed fake Live Signals ticker, replaced with honest dealership info. All homepage content now from translations.
- **10-02 (complete):** Rewrote About.tsx (329 to 313 lines), Services.tsx (186 to 85 lines), FAQ.tsx (206 to 100 lines). All three pages fully bilingual via t.about.*/t.services.*/t.faq.* keys. Added services.dontDo to translations.ts. Vehicle sales and rentals on Services page. Zero SOVEREIGN jargon on any page.
- **10-03 (complete):** Rewrote footer in App.tsx with real business info (phone, hours, social links, 4-column layout). Cleaned jargon from Finance.tsx, PaymentOptions.tsx, Legal.tsx, Policies.tsx, NotFound.tsx, VinLookup.tsx. All wired to bilingual translation system. Cleaned mobile menu jargon and "INTEL" nav label. Fixed Legal.tsx pre-existing TS error.
- **10-04 (complete):** Replaced FALLBACK_VEHICLES (Rolls-Royce $289K, Mercedes G63 $215K, Lamborghini $265K, Range Rover $85K) with realistic pre-owned vehicles (Honda Accord $6.5K, Toyota Camry $5.2K, Ford Fusion $4.8K, Chevy Equinox $3.9K). Renamed generateOpulentCaption to generateVehicleCaption with honest templates. Rewrote Gemini AI prompt for honest descriptions. Fixed SovereignCrest alt text. Standardized ALL phone numbers to (832) 400-9760 (5 files). Fixed jargon in VinLookup.tsx, Inventory.tsx, LuxuryHero.tsx. Codebase-wide sweep: zero customer-facing jargon.
- **10-05 (complete):** Rewrote all index.html meta tags (title, description, keywords), OG tags (og:title, og:description), and schema.org structured data (description, slogan, priceRange, paymentAccepted, hasOfferCatalog). Zero instances of "luxury", "Sovereign", "Kingdom", or "Identity Precedes Results" remain. All BLOCKER-severity gaps from 10-VERIFICATION.md resolved.
- **10-06 (complete):** Added 350+ bilingual translation keys for Finance, PaymentOptions, Policies, VinLookup. Wired all 4 pages to translation system (43+39+25+30 = 137 new t.* references). Replaced all VinLookup terminal/hacker jargon with professional language. Zero hardcoded English user-facing content remains on any page. All WARNING-severity gaps from 10-VERIFICATION.md resolved.

### Remaining Phase 9 Work

- **09-01:** Long-lead items (Resend DNS, repo private, A2P 10DLC) -- 100% manual
- **09-02 (remaining):** Phone OTP config in Supabase Auth dashboard -- manual
- **09-03 (remaining):** Edge Function secrets (CLI/dashboard), pg_cron (Pro plan), app.settings (Pro plan)
- **09-05:** Vercel deployment + custom domain -- manual
- **09-06:** Vehicle data migration -- manual
- **09-07:** E2E smoke test -- manual

### Remaining Phase 10 Work

None -- Phase 10 is fully complete (all original plans + gap closure plans).

### Blockers/Concerns

- Supabase Free plan limits: no pg_cron, no pg_net, Edge Function limits
- Twilio account status unknown (trial vs paid) -- blocks real OTP
- A2P 10DLC registration may take days/weeks -- start early
- Resend domain verification needs 48+ hours DNS propagation
- Edge Function secrets not set yet -- functions will fail on invocation until configured
