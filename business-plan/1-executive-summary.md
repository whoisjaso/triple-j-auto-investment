## The Problem

The used luxury car market suffers from three critical issues:

1. **Lack of Transparency**
   - Buyers struggle to verify vehicle history and condition
   - Pricing is opaque and often unfair
   - Traditional dealerships have high overhead leading to inflated prices

2. **Low Trust**
   - Independent dealers often lack credibility
   - No verifiable proof of ownership or authenticity
   - Limited recourse for buyers after purchase

3. **Inaccessible Investment Opportunities**
   - High-value vehicles require significant capital ($30k-$100k+)
   - No fractional ownership options exist
   - Passive income from vehicle appreciation unavailable to average investors
